What is not a collection?
Most of our variables have one value in them - when we put a new value in a variable, the old value is overwritten.

A list is a kind of collection
A collection allows us to put many values in a single "variable"
A collection is nice because we can carry many variables around in one convenient package

List constants
List constants are surrounded by square brackets and the elements in the list are separated by commas
A list element can be any python object - even another list
A list can be empty

Lists and definite loops
Best pals

Looking inside Lists
Just like strings, we can get at any single element in a list using an index specified in square brackets

mutable = changeable

Lists are mutable
Strings are immuable - We cannot change the contents of a string - we must make a new string to make any change
Lists are mutable - we can change an element of a list using the index operator

How long is a list
The len() function takes a list as a parameter and returns the number of elements in the list
Actually len() tells us the number of elements of any set or sequence (such as a string)

Using the range function
The range function returns a list of numbers that range from zero to one less than the parameter
We can construct an index loop for and an integer iterator

for i in range(len(friends)) :
    friend = friends[i]
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)

Concatenating lists using +
c = a + b

Lists can be sliced using :
Remeber, just like in strings, the second number is "Up to but not including"

List methods
append, count, extend, index, insert, pop, remove, reverse, sort

Building a list from scratch
We can create an empty list and then add elements using the append methods
The list stays in order and new elements are added at the end of the list

stuff = list()
stuff.append('book')
stuff.append(99)

Is something in a list?
Python provides two operators that let you check if an item is in a list
These are logical operators that return true or false
They do not modify the list

Lists are in order
A list can hold many items and keeps those items in the order until we do something to change the order
A list can be sorted
The sort method means "sort yourself"

Built-in functions and lists
There are a number or functions built into python that take lists as parameters
Remember the loops we built? These are much simpler.

numlist = list()
while True : 
    inp = input('Enter a number: ')
    if inp == 'done' : break
    value = float(input)
    numlist.append(value)

average = sum(numlist) / len(numlist)
print('Average:', average)

Best friends: Strings and lists
Split breaks a string into parts and produces a list of strings. We think of these as words.
We can access a particular word of loop through all the words.

When you do not specify a delimeter, multiple spaces are treated like one delimeter
You can specify what delimeter character to use in the splitting
thing = line.split(';')

The double split pattern
Sometimes we split a line one way, and then grab one of the pieces of the line and split that peice again
